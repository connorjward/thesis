% ----------------------------

% definitely need a section on "the rest of the software stack" - needs to be before I
% start using DMPlex terminology
% \section{Stencil languages}
% \section{Firedrake}
% \section{PyOP2}
% \section{Code generation for PDEs}

% explain loopy's programming model of kernel plus transformations. It is fundamentally
% very similar to how high level mathematical DSLs like UFL work except for loops.

\subsection{Inspector-executor model}
% two programs, an inspector that generates a schedule, and an executor that uses it. Executor
% is a transformed original program.
% these aim to improve data locality and parallelisation opportunities.
% important point is that I/E strategies utilise runtime information to generate optimal schedules
% this is very important for unstructured applications where the compilers would have a really hard time!
% we care less about parallelisation because mesh decomposition is a solved problem/out of scope
% and we, like PETSc, believe that threading is not a useful model for massively parallel
% simulations.
\cite{knepleyExascaleComputingThreads2015} % PETSc rebuttal

\cite{stroutSparsePolyhedralFramework2018} % review article
\cite{mirchandaneyPrinciplesRuntimeSupport1988} % old (general purpose) example
\cite{arenazInspectorExecutorAlgorithmIrregular2004} % fem example but specifically parallelisation
% perhaps also cite Luporini for sparse tiling? yes I think that would be good.

% Interesting note: composing inspector-executor transformations is difficult.
% see "The Sparse Polyhedral Framework: Composing Compiler-Generated Inspector-Executor Code"
% DSLs like loopy and pyop3 can make this easier to handle.


% mesh numbering is an example of an inspector-executor thing.
% so is determining core and owned to overlap communication and computation

% DSLs help a lot to implement this sort of thing because transformations can be a lot easier to
% express using a high-level representation.

% -----------------
\section{Domain-specific languages}

% UFL paper has a lot to say on this.
% special note: we use an embedded DSL for simpler interop with other libraries.
% "seamless integration with other libraries."
% also can use parser of host language

% stress "composed in arbitrary ways"
% UFL paper: "Paraphrasing P. Hudak [1996], a DSEL is the ultimate abstraction, allowing the user to reason about the program within the domain semantics, rather than within the semantics of the programming language."

% should also discuss the advantages of high level abstractions, helicopter principle?

% why not JIT like Julia or numba?
% - loses semantic information, precluding domain-specific optimisations
%   (e.g. sum factorisation (i.e. common subexpr elimination) from tensor repr)
% - we target loopy because it is a convenient abstraction for expressing the types
%   of optimisations relevant to our use case. From loopy it is more natural to lower to
%   C/CUDA than something like Julia or numba.

\subsection{An example of a complicated stencil function: solving the Stokes equations using the finite element method}

For a moderately complex stencil operation that we will refer to throughout this thesis we consider solving the Stokes equations using the finite element method (FEM)~\citep{larsonFiniteElementMethod2013}.
The Stokes equations are a linearisation of the Navier-Stokes equations and are used to describe fluid flow for laminar (slow and calm) media.
For domain $\Omega$ they are given by

% split into sub-equations that may be separately labelled
\begin{align}
  \label{strong_stokes_equation}
  - \nu \Delta u + \nabla p &= f \quad \textrm{in} \ \Omega, \\
  \nabla \cdot u &= 0 \quad \textrm{in} \ \Omega, \\
\end{align}

where $u$ is the fluid velocity, $p$ the pressure, $\nu$ the viscosity and $f$ is a known forcing term.
We also prescribe Dirichlet boundary conditions for the velocity across the entire boundary

\begin{equation}
  \label{strong_stokes_equation_bc}
  u = g \quad \textrm{on} \ \Gamma. 
\end{equation}

For the finite element method we seek the solution to the \textit{variational}, or \textit{weak}, formulation of these equations.
These are obtained by multiplying each equation by a suitable \textit{test function} and integrating over the domain.
% should use sub-equation
For \ref{strong_stokes_equation}, with $v$ as the test function and integrating by parts, this gives

% taken from https://nbviewer.org/github/firedrakeproject/firedrake/blob/master/docs/notebooks/06-pde-constrained-optimisation.ipynb
\begin{equation}
  \int \nu \nabla u : \nabla v \textrm{d}\Omega
  - \int p \nabla \cdot v \textrm{d}\Omega
  = \int f \cdot v \textrm{d}\Omega
\end{equation}

% TODO Explain reduced function spaces better to motivate V vs V_0
% Or, just say "prescribing Dirichlet boundary conditions on the full surface gives..."
Note that the surface terms from the integration by parts can be dropped since $v$ is defined to be zero at Dirichlet nodes.

For the second equation we simply get

\begin{equation}
  \int q \, \nabla \cdot u \textrm{d}\Omega = 0.
\end{equation}

In order for these equations to be well-posed we require that the functions $u$, $v$, $p$ and $q$ be drawn from appropriate function spaces\dots

% now introduce discrete function spaces V_h and Q_h and convert equations to basis function form
% with coefficients for u and p
  % the coefficients for v may be ignored as they cancel
% this is a block matrix vector system, test functions are rows and trial functions are columns
% (see Homolya thesis)

% *** Associating DoFs with mesh entities *** (new section)
% what constraints are there on the function spaces? H1 and L2
% specify the chosen element pair with Taylor-Hood (vec Pk, Pk-1, in this case k=3)?
% show what the basis functions look like, use defelement
% in FEM, basis functions overlap with points in closure(support(p)) - adjacency.

% ---

% now we have discrete basis function form, convert to a cellwise sum of integrals
% this is a stencil calculation - for each cell, compute the contribution of all basis
% functions that have support on the cell. This is closure(cell) - a stencil! Applies to both LHS and RHS

% can show my pretty diagram now!

% explain discontinuous case? interior facets? separate section.
% "just" a different stencil. find an example integral with, say, a jump term.
% could have a diagram for this too!
