\chapter{Mesh-like data layouts}
\label{chapter:mesh_data_layouts}

\pyop3 was created to provide a richer abstraction than \pyop2 for describing stencil-like operations over unstructured meshes.
Most of the innovation in \pyop3 stems from its novel data model.
Data structures associated with a mesh are created using more information about the mesh topology.
This lays the groundwork for a much more expressive DSL since more of the semantics are captured/represented.

\section{Data layouts for the finite element method}

The semantics for data kept on a mesh are not accurately captured by existing array abstractions.

% TODO does this go here? background?
Classic existing abstractions include N-dimensional array, ragged arrays and struct-of-arrays.

To provide a motivating example, consider the mesh shown in \cref{fig:XXX}. % P3 quad would look good
Degree 3 Lagrange elements have been used and these have 1 DoF per vertex, 2 per edge and 4 per cell.
DoFs are always stored contiguously per mesh point, and so the data layout for this mesh would look something like that shown in \cref{fig:YYY}.  % data layout of the mesh
It is clear that, due to the variable step size for each mesh point, an N-dimensional array (with N > 1) is a poor fit for describing the layout.
One could also view the data as just a flat array (figure ZZZ), but this loses the information about the mesh points.  % just show a diagram where nodes are indistinguishable
We can therefore conclude that mesh data layouts require a new abstraction for comprehensively describing their semantics: \textit{axis trees}.

% \subsubsection{Representing data layouts with DMPlex}
%
% DMPlex represents a mesh as a set of points where the points are divided into \textit{strata} (cells, edges, vertices, etc).
% These points are connected in a graph (Hasse diagram) and a rich set of queries can be used to determine the right adjacencies needed for things like the finite element method.
%
% In order to associated data with these mesh points, a typical PETSc application will construct a PETSc \ccode{Section}.
% These are simple CSR-like (?) data structures that encode a data layout by associating a particular number of DoFs with each mesh point.
% Sections are a powerful tool for describing data layouts but they have a number of limitations:
%
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item
%     Sections are fully ragged.
%     They only store DoF information per point in a completely unstructured way and are incapable of knowing, say, that every cell in the mesh stores exactly one DoF.
%     This can prohibit the compiler from making certain optimisations (e.g. loop unrolling) that it would have been able to do were it to know of a constant loop extent.
%     Additionally, this variable size increases memory pressure as redundant arrays of constant sizes need to be streamed through memory.
%
%   \item
%     DoFs per point are treated as a flat array.
%     This means that shape information is lost for, say, vector-valued functions.
% \end{itemize}
%
% With PETSc/DMPlex, the P3 DoF layout would be represented as shown in Figure~\ref{???}.
% % figure showing PetscSection info
%
% \subsubsection{Data layouts in \pyop2}
%
% \pyop2 takes a very different approach to describing data layouts to DMPlex.
% Firstly, it has no conception of what a mesh is and it deals solely with \textit{sets} and \textit{mappings between sets}.
% The rich query language provided by DMPlex is therefore unavailable and the task of determining the right adjacency maps is passed to the user.
%
% \subsection{What \pyop3 does}

  % start with P3?


% Introduce hierarchical data layout abstraction.
% Explain ragged, sparse data structures and PETSc integration.
% Present layout algorithm (where I tabulate the offsets).
