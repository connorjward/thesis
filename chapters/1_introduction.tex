\section{The problem domain: calculations involving mesh iteration}

\subsection{A motivating example: solving the Stokes equations using the finite element method}

As an introductory example to a calculation requiring iterating over a mesh, we consider solving the Stokes equations using the \gls{fem}.
Our exposition will focus on the aspects of the computation that are relevant for \pyop3, for a more complete review of \gls{fem} we refer the reader to~\cite{brennerMathematicalTheoryFinite2008} and~\cite{larsonFiniteElementMethod2013}.

The Stokes equations are a linearisation of the Navier-Stokes equations and are used to describe fluid flow for laminar (slow and calm) media.
For domain $\Omega$ and boundary $\Gamma$, omitting any viscosity or forcing terms for simplicity, they are given by

\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    - \Delta u + \nabla p &= 0 \quad \textrm{in} \ \Omega, \\
    %
    \nabla \cdot u &= 0 \quad \textrm{in} \ \Omega, \\
    %
    u &= g \quad \textrm{on} \ \Gamma.
  \end{align}
  %
  \label{eq:strong_stokes}
\end{subequations}

with $u$ the fluid velocity and $p$ the pressure.
We also prescribe Dirichlet boundary conditions for the velocity across the entire boundary, setting $u$ to the value of function $g$.
Since we have a coupled system of two variables ($u$ and $p$), we refer to the Stokes system as being a \textit{mixed} problem.

\subsubsection{Deriving a weak formulation}

% TODO: Add a forcing term $f$ so the RHS is non-zero so we can happily show the assembly diagram

For the finite element method we seek the solution to the \textit{variational}, or \textit{weak}, formulation of these equations.
These are obtained by multiplying each equation by a suitable \textit{test function} and integrating over the domain.
For \cref{eq:strong_stokes}, using $v$ and $q$ as the test functions, drawn from function spaces $\hat V$ and $Q$ respectively, and integrating by parts this gives

% https://nbviewer.org/github/firedrakeproject/firedrake/blob/master/docs/notebooks/06-pde-constrained-optimisation.ipynb
% and Larson and Bengzon (pg. 293)
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    \int \nabla u : \nabla v \, \textrm{d}\Omega
    - \int p \nabla \cdot v \, \textrm{d}\Omega
    - \int (\nabla u \cdot n) \cdot v \, \textrm{d}\Gamma
    - \int p n \cdot v \, \textrm{d}\Gamma
    &= 0
    &\forall \ v \in \hat V
    \label{eq:weak_stokes_extra_V} \\
    %
    \int q \, \nabla \cdot u \, \textrm{d}\Omega
    &= 0
    &\forall \ q \in Q.
    \label{eq:weak_stokes_extra_Q}
  \end{align}
  \label{eq:weak_stokes_extra}
\end{subequations}

From these weak forms it is now possible to classify the function spaces for $u$ and $p$.
For $u$, we already know that the space must be vector-valued, since it stores a velocity, and constrained to $g$ on the boundary.
\Cref{eq:weak_stokes_extra_V} further shows us that $u$ must have at least one weak derivative.
We can therefore say that $u \in V$ where

\begin{equation}
  V = \{ \ v \in [H^1(\Omega)]^d : v |_{\Gamma} = g \ \}  \\
  \label{eq:stokes_velocity_space}
\end{equation}

$p$ is scalar-valued, no derivatives of $p$ are present in the weak formulation, nor are any boundary conditions applied to it and so we can write that $p \in Q$ where

\begin{equation}
  Q = \{ \ q \in L^2(\Omega) \ \}  \\
  \label{eq:stokes_pressure_space}
\end{equation}

Since the values of $u$ at the boundary are already prescribed, the function space of the test function $v$ is defined to be zero at those nodes

\begin{equation*}
  \hat V = \{\ v \in [H^1(\Omega)]^d : v|_{\Gamma} = 0 \ \}.
\end{equation*}

This allows us to drop some terms from \cref{eq:weak_stokes_extra_V}, allowing us to state the final problem as follows:

\vspace{1em}

%TODO: Not sure how to format this best
Find $(u, p) \in V \times Q$ such that

\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    \int \nabla u : \nabla v \, \textrm{d}\Omega
    - \int p \nabla \cdot v \, \textrm{d}\Omega
    &= 0
    &\forall \ v \in \hat V
    \label{eq:weak_stokes_V} \\
    %
    \int q \, \nabla \cdot u \, \textrm{d}\Omega
    &= 0
    &\forall \ q \in Q.
    \label{eq:weak_stokes_Q}
  \end{align}
  \label{eq:weak_stokes}
\end{subequations}

\subsubsection{Discretising the system of equations}

In order to solve this weak formulation using the finite element method we discretise the function spaces in use by replacing them with a finite dimensional equivalent:

\begin{equation*}
  V \to V_h \subset V,
  \quad
  \hat V \to \hat V_h \subset \hat V,
  \quad
  Q \to Q_h \subset Q.
\end{equation*}

Each of these discrete spaces is spanned by a set of basis functions so any function can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis functions and their coefficients.
For example, we can write the function $u_h \in V_h$ as

\begin{equation*}
  u_h = \Sigma^N_{i=1} \hat u_i \psi^{V_h}_i
\end{equation*}

for basis functions $\psi^{V_h}_i$ and coefficients $\hat u_i$.

Substituting these discrete function spaces back into \cref{eq:weak_stokes}, and discarding the basis coefficients for the arbitrary functions $v_h$ and $q_h$, we obtain the discrete problem:

\vspace{1em}

%TODO: Not sure how to format this best
Find $(\hat u, \hat p)$ such that

\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    \int \hat u \nabla \psi^{V_h} : \nabla \psi^{\hat V_h} \, \textrm{d}\Omega
    - \int \hat p \psi^Q \nabla \cdot \psi^{\hat V_h} \, \textrm{d}\Omega
    &= 0
    &\forall \ \psi^{\hat V} \\
    %
    \int \psi^Q \, \nabla \cdot \hat u \psi^{V_h} \, \textrm{d}\Omega
    &= 0
    &\forall \ \psi^{Q}
  \end{align}
  \label{eq:weak_stokes_discrete}
\end{subequations}

This can be reformulated as the (saddle point) linear system

\begin{equation}
  \left (
  \begin{array}{c|c}
    \int \nabla \psi^{V_h} : \nabla \psi^{\hat V_h} \, \textrm{d}\Omega
    &
    - \int \psi^Q \nabla \cdot \psi^{\hat V_h} \, \textrm{d}\Omega \\
    \hline
    \int \psi^Q \, \nabla \cdot \psi^{V_h} \, \textrm{d}\Omega
    &
    0
  \end{array}
  \right )
  \left (
  \begin{array}{c}
    \hat u \\
    \hline
    \hat p
  \end{array}
  \right )
  =
  \left (
  \begin{array}{c}
    0 \\ \hline 0
  \end{array}
  \right )
  %
  \label{eq:stokes_linear_system}
\end{equation}

Solving the Stokes equations using the finite element method therefore boils down to constructing, or \textit{assembling}, the left-hand-side matrix and the, here trivial, right-hand-side vector before solving for the coefficients $\hat u$ and $\hat p$.

\subsubsection{The assembly algorithm}

% TODO: I reckon that this would look better if it output a small matrix which was inserted into a larger one - might be overkill though
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{fem_assembly.pdf}
  \caption{TODO}
  \label{fig:fem_assembly}
\end{figure}

% TODO: Decide on a consistent algorithm format
\begin{algorithm}
  \begin{verbatim}
    FOR EACH cell IN mesh.cells:
      FOR EACH coefficient IN expression:
        collect the coefficients of basis functions that have non-zero support over cell
      compute the integral numerically
      scatter the values of the computed integrals into the global matrix or vector
  \end{verbatim}
  \caption{TODO}
  \label{alg:fem_assembly}
\end{algorithm}

In order to assemble such a system, the integrals must be evaluated numerically for each pair of basis functions in the two function spaces.
In the finite element method this process can be done efficiently because the basis functions are defined to have \textit{local support}, that is, they are defined to be zero across almost the entire domain.
This means that, instead of iterating over all pairs of basis functions, the cells of the mesh may be visited in turn and only the basis functions with non-zero support on that cell are computed with.
These cell-wise contributions are then accumulated to form the global matrix.
Since most of the basis functions have zero overlap the resultant matrix is \textit{sparse}.

\end{figure}

The basis functions are derived from a finite element definition.
First formalised by Ciarlet~\parencite{ciarletElement2002}, a finite element is the triple $(K, P, N)$, where:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $K$ is a cell in the mesh with non-empty interior and piecewise smooth boundary,
  \item $P$ is a finite-dimensional space of functions on $K$, and
  \item $N$ is a set of linear functionals that form a basis for the dual space of $P$.
\end{itemize}

% TODO: Reword this because the point evaluation stuff is a bit confusingly worded
A simple example of a finite element, the degree 2 Lagrange element, is shown in \cref{fig:lagrange_element_2}.
For this element $K$ (the cell) is a triangle, $P$ (the function space) is the space of order 2 polynomials, and $N$ (the dual basis) is defined to be point evaluation at each of the nodes:

\begin{equation*}
  l_i(v) = v(x_i),
\end{equation*}

where $l_i$ is the linear functional associated with node $i$, $v$ is some function in $P$ and $x_i$ are the coordinates of the $i$-th node.

From these attributes, it is possible to determine a \textit{nodal basis} for $P$ by imposing that

% TODO: define n_k
\begin{equation*}
  l_i(\psi_j) = \delta_{ij} \quad i, j = 0, 1, \dots, n_k.
\end{equation*}

In the case of the degree 2 Lagrange element this yields the basis functions

% see https://defelement.com/elements/examples/triangle-lagrange-equispaced-2.html
\begin{align*}
  &\psi_0 = 2x^2 + 4xy - 3x + 2y^2-3y+1, \\
  &\psi_1 = x(2x-1), \\
  &\psi_2 = y(2y-1), \\
  &\psi_3 = 4xy, \\
  &\psi_4 = 4y(-x-y+1), \\
  &\psi_5 = 4x(-x-y+1),
\end{align*}

shown in \cref{fig:lagrange_element_2_basis}.

  \caption{Scott-Vogelius element (degree 3?)}
  \label{fig:scott_vogelius_element}
\end{figure}

The choice of basis functions used by the function spaces has significant implications for the convergence and stability of the model.
For the Stokes equations in 2D, a common choice of element pair, or \textit{mixed} element, with properties matching the constraints given in \cref{eq:stokes_velocity_space} and \cref{eq:stokes_pressure_space} is the Scott-Vogelius element~\cite{scottNormEstimatesMaximal1985}.
Shown in \cref{fig:scott_vogelius_element}, the element consists of a continuous vector-valued degree $k$ Lagrange element for the velocity space, and a discontinuous Lagrange element of degree $k-1$.
Note that the Scott-Vogelius element is known to be inf-sup stable for degree $\geq 4$ but we only show degree 3 here for brevity~\cite{guzmanScottVogeliusFiniteElements2018}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{scott_vogelius_element_dof_layout.pdf}
  \caption{TODO}
  \label{fig:scott_vogelius_element_dof_layout}
\end{figure}

With the degree 3 mixed element in \cref{fig:scott_vogelius_element}, for a one-cell mesh one has 26 unknown basis function coefficients, or \textit{degrees of freedom}: 20 for the velocity and 6 for the pressure.
As each basis function yields a single unknown, the size of the linear system in \cref{eq:stokes_linear_system} is $26 \times 26$.

% TODO: reword
In \cref{eq:stokes_linear_system} the different function spaces have been partitioned to produce a block matrix system.
Naturally the choice of how to lay these values out in memory is arbitrary, but a common approach is to split them by function space, then by topological entity, and then by vector component (\cref{fig:scott_vogelius_element_dof_layout})
% This choice of finite element pair means that one would have, for a single element mesh, 26 (?) unknown basis coefficients (DoFs), and the matrix would have 26 rows and 26 columns (and would in fact be dense)

% On massively parallel machines we parallelise our computation by partitioning the mesh between processes
% * Basis functions whose support crosses into another process are stored in that processes "halo"
% * Show a simple diagram - continue to use triangles (and basis functions)
% * The global matrix is also partitioned, usually by row, so each process only sees a portion of it

%NOTE:I could perhaps talk about mesh renumbering here - I kind of want a "FEM optimisations" section to talk about it
%NOTE: No need to discuss numbering here because for a single cell it isn't a thing

\section{Execution models for unstructured meshes}

% TODO:: cite dune, deal.ii, Firedrake, FENIcs, devito...?
At this point we have established, excluding the local kernels and global solve, the algorithms and data structures necessary to solve a finite element problem.
Subsequently, we are interested in how to manifest these in software.
Writing these codes by hand is prohibitively difficult: writing a performant and scalable simulation would take months or years of programmer effort and any changes to the \glspl{pde}, discretisation or hardware might constitute a substantial rewrite.
To counter this, numerous frameworks exist providing the building blocks from which a domain specialist, without expertise in high performance computing nor months of programmer time, might build a simulation.
This creates a separation of concerns between the framework maintainers, who specialise in low-level optimisation, and the users, who can instead reason about the problem in terms of the mathematics.

% talk about BLIS, Spiral, FFTW, Halide etc?
In addition to the step-change in programmer productivity, high-level abstractions also facilitate advanced performance optimisations that would be very difficult to implement for a low-level code.
Sometimes, high-level algorithmic changes (discretisation, solver, etc) are required to achieve acceptable performance on a given machine and having a high-level of abstraction means that tweaking these options is minimally invasive \parencite{betteridgeCodeGenerationProductive2021}.
Further, having a high-level representation of the problem enables optimisations best expressed at the level of the mathematics that would otherwise be very challenging to implement (e.g.~\cite{homolyaExposingExploitingStructure2017}).

For the unstructured mesh traversal operation we are interested in, we need an abstraction that:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Expresses operations in terms of loops, compact kernels and restricted data structures,
  \item
    Supports the indirection mappings necessary for unstructured meshes (e.g. the map from cells to supported DoFs), and
  \item
    Is backend agnostic: the same code should be able to target different architectures with almost no changes.
\end{itemize}

% NOTE: badly written, combine with the above into a single set of requirements
Along with these hard requirements we also have a number of strongly desirable features.
The software should:

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    Be composable: support nested loops, multiple kernels and map composition,

  \item
    Interoperate with external packages (PETSc),

  \item
    Support distributed memory parallelism (i.e. MPI).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Existing software}

A number of packages exist that already meet most or all of these requirements:

\paragraph{Liszt}{
  is a \gls{dsl} embedded in Scala\footnotemark~\cite{devitoLisztDomainSpecific2011}.
  Mesh connectivity is expressed through built-in topological relations and mesh data is associated with specific topological entities.
  Liszt uses a custom mesh implementation with support for parallel partitioning and hence works in a distributed memory environment.
  Liszt is also capable of generating code for use in a multi-threaded or GPU context.
}

\paragraph{Simit}{
  is another \gls{dsl} for mesh simulations\footnotemark[\value{footnote}]~\cite{kjolstadSimitLanguagePhysical2016}.
  It has a unique design where mesh data structures have a dual representation: they can either be viewed as a hypergraph or as a multi-dimensional tensor.
  This enables for both mesh-like queries to be applied to the data structures as well as enabling linear algebra operations to be expressed.
  Simit is capable of targeting both CPUs and GPUs without needing to change the input code, though distributed memory computing is not available.
}

\paragraph{Ebb}{
  is another \gls{dsl} embedded in Lua\footnotemark[\value{footnote}]~\cite{bernsteinEbbDSLPhysical2016}.
  It uses a relational database model to describe the mesh and has a 3-layer infrastructure that separates simulation code from data structure specification and different code generation targets.
  It has support for execution on GPUs but distributed memory computing is not available.
}

\footnotetext{No longer actively maintained.}

\paragraph{OP2}{
  Unlike the frameworks mentioned above, OP2 is an \textit{active library framework} that provides source-to-source translation from C, C\+\+ or Fortran to target a range of different backends including OpenMP, CUDA and OpenCL~\cite{mudaligeOP2ActiveLibrary2012}.
  OP2 uses a simplified model of a mesh where entities are represented as \textit{sets}.
  One can store data on these sets and mappings exist between sets.
  Computations are termed \textit{kernels} and are provided by the user.
  Distributed memory computing is possible and OP2 is even able to interleave computation and communication to provide improved scaling.
}

\paragraph{\pyop2}{
  is a reimplementation of OP2 in Python~\cite{rathgeberPyOP2HighLevelFramework2012}.
  The same core abstraction of sets, mappings and kernels is used but runtime code generation is used instead of source-to-source translation.
  \pyop2 currently only targets execution on CPUs though a proof-of-concept GPU extension has been created~\cite{fenics2021-kulkarni}.
  Distributed memory computing is supported and \pyop2 can also assemble sparse matrices with PETSc~\cite{petsc-web-page,petsc-user-ref,petsc-efficient}.
}

\subsection{Limitations}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{scott_vogelius_element_dof_layout_pyop2.pdf}
  \caption{
    The data layout matching \cref{fig:scott_vogelius_element_dof_layout} as it would be stored by \pyop2.
    Data for each function space ($V_h$ and $Q_h$) is stored in a separate array.
  }
  \label{fig:scott_vogelius_element_dof_layout_pyop2}
\end{figure}
% in fig pyop2:
    "Each function space is stored in a separate array and topological information is not available." This lets us use 10x2 and 6x1 N-dim arrays for the storage at the cost of losing top. info

OP2 and \pyop2 are limited in their expressive power by the decision to admit a single entry point to the libraries.
They both only work for the case where a single computational kernel is being executed inside a single loop.
Whilst appropriate for a great many operations, there are occasions where one needs to be able to execute multiple kernels or have nested loops - for example when developing certain types of preconditioners (e.g. \cite{gibsonSlateExtendingFiredrake2020}, \cite{farrellPCPATCHSoftwareTopological2021}).
In these cases one has to extend the compiler in a sui-generis manner to achieve the desired result, resulting in code that is harder to maintain and not composable with other features.

% TODO: get the wording right...
% * difficult to write/program in because sets are not totally natural (esp. when we have node sets) (bookkeeping job of developer)
Further, the set-and-mapping design of the libraries can be difficult to reason about
This imposes additional burden on the library's users who must be responsible for the bookkeeping to correctly handle the mappings between sets.

Considering the data layout shown in \cref{fig:scott_vogelius_element_dof_layout}, \pyop2 would store represent it as a tuple of two \textit{node sets} (\cref{fig:scott_vogelius_element_dof_layout_pyop2}).
Compared with the ``lossless" representation in \cref{fig:scott_vogelius_element_dof_layout}, this approach simplifies the implementation because the data can now be stored as 2 rectangular arrays with shapes \pycode{(10, 2)} and \pycode{(6, 1)}.
However, this simplified view discards topological information - the ``Mesh" layer of the representation is gone - meaning that the library user has to do the bookkeeping to correctly handle the mappings from mesh entities to nodes.

% Simit Ebb Liszt are fine for this, but they are doomed to fail because:...
    \textbf{Custom mesh representations}
    Despite boasting much richer and expressive abstractions to OP2 and \pyop2, the execution models of Liszt, Simit and Ebb accomplish this via the introduction of their own custom mesh representations.
    This choice causes certain challenges:
    (a) Poor interoperability with existing software,
    (b) Unrelated but essential mesh operations (e.g. I/O, parallel distribution) must be reimplemented. This results in a maintainence burden that is unsustainable, as evidenced by the fact that none of the listed projects are still maintained.

% maybe also talk about data layout considerations? could reference the data layout for SV elem

\subsection{\pyop3}


To address the gap between the simpler, more compatible execution models of OP2 and \pyop2 with the expressivity of Liszt, Simit and Ebb, we have developed a new library: \pyop3.
\pyop3 is a near-total rewrite of \pyop2 that aims to substantially improve its expressivity power and composability.
Core to this contribution is the development of a novel data structure descriptor, the \textit{axis tree} (\cref{chapter:mesh_data_layouts}), that extends \pyop2's lossy set representation such that it is capable of fully describing complex mesh data layouts such as that shown in \cref{fig:scott_vogelius_element_dof_layout}.

% NOTE: reword? link to PETSc earlier?

% Compatibility with existing libraries is an explicit goal of the library, and hence we are MPI parallel by default (section 6) and support a wide range of sparse matrix types.
% There is also scope for GPU support in future, again most of the work has been done for us.
