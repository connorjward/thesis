\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I am very lucky to be able to say that I have honestly enjoyed almost every second (thesis writing notwithstanding!) of my PhD.
The fact that I can say this is down entirely to the wonderful people I have had the pleasure of spending time with over the last four years.

My supervisors, David and Jack have been extremely helpful.
David is a depthless font of knowledge on all things, not only finite element, and his experience has been invaluable for my research.
Jack has been my closest friend throughout the PhD... I look forward to him making me even more cups of coffee in the future.

Both have been very supportive of me throughout.
% both very supportive, including my welfare
% From starting my PhD with a very loose remit I had the freedom to choose my research (which has hopefully produced a good result)...

I would also like to thank my colleagues in the core Firedrake team, both past and present: Koki, Daiane, Nacime, Reuben, Sophia - for their helpfulness and companionship.
As is often said, it is the community that Firedrake has that makes it so special and that was certainly the case for me.

Further thanks are due to the wonderful group of friends that I have shared an office with these past four years: Thivan, Sara, Jamie, Karina, Henry, and Maria.
% "evenings spent playing board games..."
% the friendliest office in all of Huxley and I count myself very lucky to have gotten to know you all.

Lastly my deepest thanks go to my family and partner, Rhiannon, ...
% over Covid?
Rhiannon has heard more about my `trees and triangles' than anyone else.
